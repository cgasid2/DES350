		<h1>Good design is innovative</h1>
		<p>Good design is advanced and upgraded from what it used to<br> be before.<br>
		My iPhone 8 Plus is the newer version of the iPhone 7 Plus because it is water resistant and is slightly bigger than the 7 Plus. Also the battery lasts a little longer than in the iPhone 7 Plus.<br>
		Applying this principle into graphic design would work through the creation of websites, making it accessible and easy to function for people to understand how or where they should click in order to read information on the site.</p></div>

	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:45%;padding-top:40%;padding-bottom:20%;">
		<h1>Good design makes a product useful</h1>
		<p>Good design has a purpose.<br>
		A remote control to a t.v. is a product that has a purpose for its usage. It is organized from top to bottom with buttons that have its own purpose and are separated into categories through <br>its functions.<br>
		I would not apply this principle in my work because most of graphic design is done digitally and it’s not a physical product that can carry out usage, but instead, information.</p></div>

	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:65%;padding-top:45%;padding-bottom:20%;">
		<h1>Good design is aesthetic</h1>
		<p>Good design is creative.<br>
		My lotion bottle (Bath and Body Works) is a product I use everyday that affects my well-being because it’s part of my routine to use it after I shower. And part of choosing which lotion I want to purchase is through it’s little sticker design with a creative name of scent it <br>carries out.<br>
		When I created a poster for an event that will take place in the future, I made sure that I applied this principle into my work of art. I have already received many compliments on the poster saying it’s very beautiful and eye-catching.</p></div>

	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:45%;padding-top:40%;padding-bottom:20%;">
		<h1>Good design makes a product understandable</h1>
		<p>Good design is recognizable for the product’s usage.<br>
		My little portable radio is self-explanatory for what it is used for because of the buttons located at the top of the main structure and the antenna.<br>
		I would not apply this principle into graphic design because it’s not a physical product that can carry out its usage but a message.</p></div>
	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:48%;margin-top:-45.7%;"><h3>four</h3></div>
	
	
	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:37%;padding-top:35%;padding-bottom:20%;">
		<h1>Good design is unobtrusive</h1>
		<p>Good design is modest.<br>
		Traffic lights are not something I use everyday because I don’t drive but they are modest in their own way because they’re not decorative, yet they are restrained.<br>
		I have not applied this principle into any of my works, yet, but hopefully I will get the chance to.</p></div>
	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:33.5%;margin-top:-44.15%;"><h2>five</h2></div>
	
	
	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:45%;padding-top:40%;padding-bottom:20%;">
		<h1>Good design is honest</h1>
		<p>Good design is straightforward.<br>
		I believe that my airpods are straightforward for what they are supposed to be used for and the directions to how they work are simply easy to follow which not only keep myself satisfied with their function but most likely everyone else who uses them.<br> 
		I would apply this principle in all of my work because I think it’s important that creating something needs to be straightforward with its purpose and like mentioned on the website “Not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept”.</p></div>

	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:65%;padding-top:45%;padding-bottom:20%;">
		<h1>Good design is long-lasting</h1>
		<p>Good design is enduring.<br>
		Furniture is the first thing that came up in my head because not only it is expensive but it’s most likely to stay in my house for a while. Most of my furniture is simple, not too decorative, just modern.<br> 
		I would not apply this principle into any of my work because most of graphic design is not long-lasting but it’s only there for a short period of time. In my opinion, design changes and there is always something new that comes in whether it’s color, style, format, fonts.</p></div>
	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:66%;margin-top:-54%;"><h4>seven</h4></div>	
	
	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:45%;padding-top:40%;padding-bottom:20%;">
		<h1>Good design is thorough down to the last detail</h1>
		<p>Good design is always perfection.<br>
		My laptop follows this principle because every detail is accurate up to the point that it all goes well together. From the appearance to the placement of the speakers, keyboard, touch ID and touchbar, it all perfectly aligns with everything.<br>
		I had used this principle many times because I always focus on every detail when I design posters or when I take photos, I try to make sure that my cropping is perfect and does not have any random things before I snap the picture.</p></div>
	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:48%;margin-top:-51.2%;"><h3>eight</h3></div>
	
	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:37%;padding-top:35%;padding-bottom:20%;">
		<h1>Good design is environmentally friendly</h1>
		<p>Good design is the earth’s best friend.<br>
		My water bottle follows this principle because it is a product that will let its users continue drinking water, without having to use plastic water bottles that can harm animals in the future, and can also be refilled constantly.<br>
		Well, printing out paper and constantly using paper does not make this process environmentally friendly. But applying this principle through the digital world can be earth’s best friend because nowadays, everything is on social media so less paper gets used.</p></div>
	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:33.4%;margin-top:-49.6%;"><h2>nine</h2></div>
	
	
	<div style="width:30%; margin-left:45%;padding-top:40%;padding-bottom:15%;">
		<h1>Good design is as little design as possible</h1>
		<p>Good design is minimal.<br>
		The Tesla car, which I certainly don’t have, is a great example of this principle because inside the car, there is only a tablet that functions as all the buttons a regular car would have in the front. But something that I use everyday that also follows this principle is my phone because it only has one button on the screen and the rest is just touchscreen.<br>
		I have not applied this principle in my work but when I intend to, I will try to make sure it’s less but better. And I also like it simple.</p></div>
